# LeetCode

I am studying algorithms and computer science by making problems in 3 or 4 sites. This is the repository I am using to store the problems I solved for [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).

Everything that it's stored under `/solved` got an ACCEPTED, sometimes I will make some intermediate commits under the root directory just to save them somewhere else or perhaps to discuss the code with someone else.
